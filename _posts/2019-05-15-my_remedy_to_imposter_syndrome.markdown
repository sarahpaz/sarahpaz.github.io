Making the decision to learn how to code isn't an easy one. There's a lot of back and forth (mostly with yourself) wondering - "Can I really do this?". Well, I'm no pro - I was in that exact situation maybe 6 months ago when I started the online self-paced software engineering program at Flatiron School. 

I fell in live with `code` when I wrote my first `<marquee>` tag many years ago. I've taken various online courses, part-time courses in College, and even have a certificate in Web Development. But I never really felt confident, I never continued to practice, and when it really came down to it, I think it was my fear of not knowing enough, or not being good enough that held me back. Soon I realized it was a fight with [imposter syndrome](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/real-women/201809/the-reality-imposter-syndrome). 

Now, as I'm mid-journey, tackling lab after lab, I've learned what helps me fight off imposter syndrome when I feel it sneaking back my way. If you can relate (and I'm sure someone out there can), here's the remedy that has been working for me. Feel free to take what works for you, change what doesn't, tweak where needed, etc! And please, if you have more tips feel free to share them with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/heysarahpaz)!

## Kicking Imposter Syndrome Where it Hurts:
### 1. Build / grow your community! 
When I started my journey, I became more active on Twitter and wow - what a difference that has made! I'm currently on day 85 in the ***#100DaysOfCode*** challenge! This has really kept me on track with practicing what I've learned, or even helped me dedicate time every day towards labs / lessons. The support system of devs online is also incredible! I've made some Flatiron School friends, and have connected with other seasoned developers eager to share their knowledge with newbies like myself. 

##### Takeaway: Surround yourself with a community of people share your passion for code! 

### 2. Accountability is key!
This goes hand in hand with growing your community. I would highly recommend being active on Flatiron's slack channels and study groups. A month or so in, I connected with another student who I met through a study group. We've pair programmed, and kept in touch with each other's progress, stresses, challenges etc. It's really great to have someone who keeps you accountable. It's so great, why stop at one person?! Since I've connected with her, I've also connected with 2 other students (both, in different sections in the program) who have been crucial in keeping me accountable. We have a shared chat in Slack and every morning / evening and throughout the day we'll check in on each other, send our goals for the day, and really push and encourage each other to hit those goals. Having people keep you accountable ensures that you utilize your time wisely! 

##### Takeaway: Grow a circle of accountability partners. Verbalize your goals, see them, feel them, make them happen!

### 3. Good habits == happy coder! 
Make the time to code! Build habits! Do what it takes to ensure you've built coding into your daily routines. Hitting your goals become so much easier, once those habits have been created. 

##### Takeaway: Build the habits, and you'll hit your goals. It's that simple!

### 4. Set a schedule!
This is probably more so for the self-paced students out there, but setting a schedule has really worked wonders for me! I have a whiteboard calendar in my office, where I write my goals of which section I want to be in by when. Having this visual in my face at all times really does help push me. It's also fun to reward yourself if you finish a section earlier than planned - we work hard, why not treat ourselves! All wins are wins!

##### Takeaway: If you're self-paced, build your structure! Set goals, make a schedule! Be serious about your selfmade deadlines!



I hope you've found this helpful! And when you're feeling like you're starting to second guess yourself, stop, take a moment and think back at how far you've come! Be confident, you really do know more than you think! 

Happy Coding!

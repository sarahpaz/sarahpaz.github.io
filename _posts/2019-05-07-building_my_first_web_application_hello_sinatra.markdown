I've made it to the second portfolio project! And as excited, nervous and confused as I've felt coming to this point there is one huge takeaway I'd like to share. 

> If you feel like you're lost, you're not alone! You'll be surprised at how much you actually know once you get into the flow of things and start coding! 
> 

With that being said, this is exactly what I did to start my project and switch from feeling *imposter syndrome* take over, to impressing myself with what I was able to build! Sure, it can be better - but so can I.. and with time, that's exactly what I plan on doing. 
### Watch Instruct Videos:
Sure, there are probably tons of videos on [Learn Instruct](https://instruction.learn.co) that will help you on your Sinatra Project journey, but these are the ones in specific that helped me:

### RSVP to Study Groups:
There are tons of study groups available from AMA's to project prep, and even project builds! Join them! I joined them before I started my project to get a better feel of what is expected, and to hear other students questions. You'll learn a lot about what you need to include in these groups so don't miss them! It's also a great away to not only interact with your project support lead, but other students who are currently building their web application. Ask all the questions you need!
### Plan:
I can't stress this enough, and it may seem like common sense but finally completing Fwitter and reading through the Sinatra Project Requirements will definitely stir up some excitement and an urge to code. Before you do, go through each of the requirements and make notes on how your application idea will meet them.

My first step was creating a Projects folder on my machine, creating a new file (NOTES.md) in it, and pasting the project requirements in it. Eventually this NOTES.md was used to add any other project notes I had like potential stretch goals etc.
### Create Your Project Structure:
`gem install corneal` and thank me later! Corneal is a magical gem that quickly creates your Sinatra template. More info on it [here](https://thebrianemory.github.io/corneal/).
### Set a Goal / Functionality First:
I'm a self-paced student, so to stay on track with when I wanted to complete this project by I had to set some goals. Daily goals, weekly goals etc. For example, I made sure I had the login and signup capabilities set up one day, and so on. If you use Corneal it does come with some default styling which is great on it's own! I got into this project knowing I wanted to style it a bit more though, as I'm moving through the curriculum I'm starting to build out my portfolio and I wanted to have a unique and completely designed by me project. Before you do decide to add styling, ensure the functionality is down pact first. CRUD is completely working, and you've hit your project requirements. 

## Be Prepared for Frustration
With learning anything new comes frustration. Be prepared to feel overwhelmed or confused. It's completely fine, and part of the learning process.

Here are a few tips that helped me get through this:
1. Commit, and commit often! The last thing you want is to forget to commit, run `git status` and see you've got changes on almost all your files and you don't remember what you changed where! 
2. Issues with `shotgun`? It has happened a couple times through this project where I'd get a RuntimeError. It drove me insane until I came across [this article](https://medium.com/@virtual_khan/sinatra-and-shotgun-problems-with-port-9393-in-use-73735f353d26). Bookmark it while you're working on your project, it'll come handy!
3. Take breaks! A lot of times I'd get stuck trying to think of the logic for validations, and surprisingly the logic came to me when I'd take a break. Take a 5 minute shower, go for a run, grab a snack. You'll be amazed at how much makes sense once you take your eyes away from the code. 
4. Ask for help and feedback! Building the user experience made sense to me, but I wanted another user to go through and point out where messaging was missing or where the user flow just didn't make sense. Fresh eyes are always a great way to catch inconsistencies you may have missed.

### Don't forget to have fun! You're doing great, next up Rails!

Deciding to pursue a career as a software engineer was a huge and scary leap to take. But nothing worthwhile comes easy, right? 

The way I see it, coding is empowerment. It enables you to build tools, improve processes, solve the unsolveable and create the future. It pushes you to think logically, and creatively and is a career where learning is constant and challenges are plenty. And as unappealing as that may sound to many people, I'm a life-long student at heart who loves tackling problems head on, and dissecting issues to find the root cause. With that being said, software development just felt right! 

Coding to me is more than just a career or passion, it's a movement! It opens doors to the future, and being a queer woman of color, I see the need for more woman leaders in tech and am inspired to be a fighting force paving that path. We deserve a fair battlefield, speaking up is one thing - but taking the step to directly impact the much needed shift in society is what I aim to do.

After building my Sinatra app, having to create each route, and have a more *"hands on"* build, it's easy to say I was excited for all this highly spoken of ***Rails magic***. I'll be honest, the transition between Sinatra and Rails was pretty tough for me. I actually really enjoyed the amount of control I had with Sinatra, being able to build what I needed when I needed, vs all the auto-*magic* Rails provided. Yes, I know - it sounds silly. Who doesn't like work done for them right? This all leads me to what I've learned within the Rails section.

## 3 Key Takeaways
1. **Everyone struggles** - It's part of the process! So your questions are not stupid. In other words, ask all the questions you need, and don't be afraid to reach out to other students for help. It's incredible how willing the dev community is. 
2. **Mischief over Magic** - This part is huge. Yes, I did feel like Rails did too much for me to the point it was more michievous than magical. My issue was, I didn't fully grasp what exactly Rails did! Of course it would feel overwhelming if I didn't really know where what was coming from, like someone was messing with my code to drive me crazy (which it did!). Solution - Research! Always look into other resources if you're stuck. Whether it be study groups, section leads, websites, other students, or our best friend Google. One resource in particular that I found really started to help tie things together for me was [The Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://https://www.railstutorial.org/book), please check it out!
3. **Take your time**- Rails does a lot! It's magical for a reason, and with that being said - before you jump the gun and sprinkle Rails fairy dust all over your code expecting to have everything just work, really take the time to understand what is happening. What happens within the Models, Views, Controllers, where connections are made, understand the importance of keeping a clean separation of concerns so when something does break, it's easier to narrow down the bug. Don't try to rush through, trust me - you'll wish you didnt. 

## Project Mode (Yay!)
Okay, finally - project mode. I think it's important to choose something of interest to build, that way it becomes a fun learning experience. I decided to build another version of my Sinatra App [Mile Marker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkcNXmNiLns&t=7s) which was a running app for a user to track their individual runs. My Rails app is called **Boost**, another running app focused on raising money with every run you track. 

### Here's a brief description:
With every mile a user runs, a donation is made to a charity of their choice. Users can select an exisiting charity, or create a new one. They can view how much they've raised for their top 3 charities, and how much they've raised in total. They can also view other users runs, and on each charities show page, they can see the top user who has raised the most money for that charity.

### Process Makes Perfect
My advice for anyone starting their project, plan out your associations and your models perfectly before building anything. Ensure your join table is set up, as that's probably one of the most important aspects of this project. And like anything, a strong base is key! Having this set up right from the beginning ensures everything will run smooth*er*. You will definitely still have a ton of hiccups. That's part of the learning process, and to be honest - Rails didn't really start to make sense to me until project mode hit. ***It's fight or flight, I chose to fight!***

### Project Tips
Here are some quick tips and key points of struggle I had with my Rails project:
1. Keep a NOTES.md file, and clearly separate your requirements from your 'nice-to-haves'. This keeps you focused on hitting your project requirements, and keeps you on track and outta the code hole that we all tend to fall into. 'Nice-to-haves' are great features to add on after you've completed your project review, but don't let those take away from the goal. Requirements first!
2. Bootstrap! Getting sucked into HTML/CSS will probably happen. But for project purposes, to have a simple and styled app that is responsive is definitely the direction to go. I found this article very helpful in setting up Bootstrap on my app, have a look! [How to add Bootstrap 4 to a Rails 5 app](https://medium.com/@biancapower/how-to-add-bootstrap-4-to-a-rails-5-app-650118459a1e).
3. User walkthrough. I had a friend walk through my app, and use it as she'd intend to. When navigating through your own app, you'll usually miss steps other people would think of because you're so used to a specific journey. Having someone else walk through it is a great way to catch those pesky bugs you missed. I found about 3 bugs while having this done. Great way to catch anything you may have overlooked!


### Final Project Thoughts
***Don't be afraid, take the leap!*** This was an issue I've dealt with, and I would encourage you to push through the fear and take the leap. I've met all requirements for a while, and have been refactoring and styling simply because I'm afraid to move forward. This by far was a lot tougher than the CLI and Sinatra projects. This project had the most requirements, and all the power of Rails was difficult for me to grasp. I let the fear get to me... But, I didn't come this far to be afraid of the code I write. Completing this blog post brings me one step closer to my assessment, and another blog post will follow after that with my video walkthrough and feelings on how it felt to conquer this milestone. 

Thanks Rails, it's been fun, but I'm ready for JavaScript!
